One of our clients needs a command line tool to do some math tasks. Can you create the tool by following pseudo code ?

    Let x = 1
    Let y = 2
    Let answer += (x * y) + xy [here xy = 12]
    Repeat this calculation till you have x = 666
    The final answer will be the flag when x = 666

Flag Format : KCTF{answer_here}
Example Flag : KCTF{123}
